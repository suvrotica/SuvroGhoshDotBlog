While it may be true that the drivel in this blog is often directed by the lava under the landscape, it is not a coincidence but a precondition for it. Imagine a sunny, windswept, clear sky day with joy and that sort of fare. Would you be likely to partake in the outdoors, or would you more likely decide to stay indoors on a clime much less salubrious and brood or rest? And rest, again, is the devil's workshop, as it says in the card.

Plainly, it is the mind not without its context, the underlying biology, and the long history of neurobiochemistry through the many parts, from smaller to the smallest parts, down to the quantum level where jostling atoms and vibrations in lattices result in an offensive limerick or a soporific number like this. I am the same person; it's just that if I were to be an average of the various types of mood that come upon me, it wouldn't be me but just another wool over your eyes, like the pleasing clatter of the typewriter given to an automaton who nonetheless types the same nondescript keys, or the newfangled statistical generations in our transformer models.

There's an endless amount of words coming out of people on social media, and I try to stay as far away as I can from the mere word ordering that happens in a billion permutations without any added merit. I live in my own box, with the window only slightly ajar to make sense of the street bickering I overhear. Most of the anger in me is a form of representational anger that isn't grounded in the reality of the world as much as in what I make of it as a person who is mentally ill and often has raw emotions at his disposal. I empty my mind of its contents, no matter what it contains—trivial or vulgar—it only has to be in the catharsis that ends in a caricature or meandering slide into the darker, more obscene, and obscure sides of my mind.

And even if people don't see any merit, I persist because my introduction to the Indian psyche was a late and tumultuous one. If I can at least help someone as gullible and unmoored in this haven of nonstop lying and cheating at every dimension of civilian and business life, I may be making the only good use of the leisure hours at my disposal.

Satire is the only way I know to make my revisits into my own personal miseries tolerable. Although the deficiency is a larger problem in society, my failing is not having the antenna for it that so many Indians seem to naturally have. This absence of an antenna is even more pronounced as the children growing up today are just pink urban flesh devoid of any shell.

While the goal of a good education in India seems to be only to be good enough to leave the country for a job abroad, this is the worst sort of plan any country can have. Just as people feel justified in laughing at me for coming back from America, I too feel it must be my right to point out that their sense of humor is entirely misplaced and is at the core of the hemorrhage that has caused India to be only an export hub of clerks or an outsource shop for cheap labor.
